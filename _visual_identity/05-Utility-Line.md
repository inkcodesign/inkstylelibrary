title: Utility Line
permalink: "/utility-line/"
examples:
- explanation: The most common use of the utility line is to separate a title from
    its content. The gap below the line can be larger than the gap above, but at a
    minimum it should be equivalent.

  is-good: true
- explanation: This is an instance in which the utility line is unneccessary, as it
    is neither functioning to separate vertical content or to direct attention towards
    something.

- explanation: In a stack of content types, a small utility line can be used to separate
    the elements into groups. Here it is being used to separate Starr's name and title
    from her bio.

  is-good: true
- explanation: A longer utility line can function as a structural element, for instance,
    here, where it is used to signify the end of the article and provide a division
    before the share links below.

  is-good: true
- explanation: The utility line can be used to direct the reader's eye, for instance,
    here, where it is being used to draw the eye towards the content from the title
    above.

  is-good: true
- explanation: Be careful not to overdo it! Too many utility lines can start to clutter
    the layout and make it difficult for a reader to navigate.
