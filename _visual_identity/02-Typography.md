Readability Guidelines:
  Line height: Refer to the typography scales below when structuring line height.
    Generally, our collateral should follow this scale.
  Line length: It is considered a good practice to keep lines between 50-75 characters.
    Cases vary depending on the situation, but this serves as a general rule of thumb
    when designing layouts.
  Text alignment: Our content is typically left-aligned. Be sensible in deviating
    from this standard, as justifying, centering, and right-aligning text can lead
    to decreased readability.
  Font weight: Use the bold version of Brandon Text to add emphasis and differentiate
    content hierarchy.
Our Fonts Text: |-
  Our display font is League Gothic, a condensed sans serif that references INKâ€™s confidence and bold marketing solutions when used in all-caps.

  Our secondary headline and body copy font is Brandon Text, a warm, geometric sans serif designed for legibility.
