**Our Fonts**

Our display font is League Gothic, a condensed sans serif that references INKâ€™s confidence and bold marketing solutions when used in all-caps.

Our secondary headline and body copy font is Brandon Text, a geometric sans serif with a subtle warmth and high x-height for optimal legibility.

Use the following table as a reference when creating collateral for INK. While exact values will change depending on the medium, you should  maintain the following hierarchy ratios between different styles regardless of the final medium.
