title: Colors
permalink: "/colors/"
primary-description: The majority of simple, type-focused design applications should
  only use the colors from the Primary Palette. The restrained use of color is essential
  to the INK brand; see below for details on how to appropriately use our other colors.
neutral-description: Use these colors when more than one neutral shade are needed,
  for instance in a table of data or for structural design elements like horizontal
  rules and borders. Study the design of this website to see how to the Neutral Palette
  can be used.
extended-description: Use these colors for illustration and data visualization when
  more than one shade of green are needed.
auxiliary-description: Use these colors sparingly and purposefully, for instance, if
  our company culture is the collateral's focus. If in doubt, ask the Design Team
  for approval!
