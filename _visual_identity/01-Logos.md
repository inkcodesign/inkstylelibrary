#### **Logo Usage Guidelines**

Our primary logo should be used whenever possible. The secondary lockup may be used as needed if it is better suited to the applied space.

The INK logo should not be presented in any color other than Concrete Jungle Grey or Starr White. Use the knocked out, white version when overlaid on imagery or on backgrounds with which the grey version would create insufficient contrast.
