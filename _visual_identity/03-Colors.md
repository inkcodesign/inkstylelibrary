#### **Color Usage Guidelines**

Our primary colors consist mostly of white, green, and grey. Restricting the use of color for INK's brand applications will ensure we consistently communicate our professional and confident tone.

Our secondary colors are used sparingly and purposefully, like when our company culture is the collateral's focus.

Tertiary colors are used for illustration and data visualization when more than two shades of green are needed.
