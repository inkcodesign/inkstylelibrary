#### **Our House Style**

INK primarily adheres to [AP Style](https://www.apstylebook.com/){:target="_blank"}. However, we do use the Oxford comma.

#### **Writing Guidelines**

* **POV:** Generally use first or second person to connect with the audience. People love hearing about themselves – framing situations with "you" and "your" will help the reader think about their own perspective and challenges.
* **Keep it simple:** "Don't use a five-dollar word when a fifty-cent word will do,” - Mark Twain.
  * Use, instead of utilize
  * Show, instead of demonstrate
  * Consider, instead of take into consideration
  * Right now, instead of at the present time
* **Avoid repetition:** Get rid of duplicated words in the same sentence or across paragraphs (if possible), unless there is a purpose.
* **Limit weak words and hedging words:** Somewhat, a little, rather, arguably, we think, we believe
* **Make sure what you mean is what you say:** Be careful that the word you choose reflects its true meaning.
* **Go beyond business as usual:** Showcase our unique thinking or how we're approaching a problem differently.
* **Empower the reader:** Never talk down to our audience or underestimate their experience and expertise. Instead of "You should do this," we might say, "This will give you these benefits." 
* **Punch it up:** Strive to use strong, illustrative words. Avoid overused and watered down words like "good," "great," and "things." 
* **Use exclamation points sparingly:** "Settle down," - Blair Poloskey.
* **Avoid industry- or INK-specific jargon:** Words like byline, coverage, deck, drinking the Kool-Aid, package up, voiceover, gut check.
* **Avoid overused buzzwords:** Innovative, groundbreaking, disruptive, pioneering
* **Avoid scare tactics:** Instead of "Are you missing out on media opportunities?" we might say, "This can help you differentiate your company's story and secure media opportunities."
