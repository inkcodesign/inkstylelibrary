**Logo Usage Guidelines**

Our primary logo should be used whenever possible. The secondary lockup may be used as needed.

Choose the option that best fits the applied space. White versions of the logo are available and should be substituted when use of the grey logo would result in insufficient contrast with the background.


The INK logo should not be presented in any color other than grey or white.
