Our display font is League Gothic, a condensed sans serif that references INKâ€™s confidence and bold marketing solutions when used in all-caps.

Our secondary headline and body copy font is Brandon Text, a warm, geometric sans serif designed for legibility.

#### **Readability Guidelines**

* **Line height:** Refer to our Typography Scale when structuring line height. Generally, our collateral should follow this scale.

* **Line length (measure):** It's considered a good practice to keep lines between 50-75 characters. Cases vary depending on the situation, but this serves as a general rule of thumb for designing layouts.

* **Text alignment:** Our content is typically left-aligned and ragged right. Be sensible in deviating from this standard, as justifying, centering, and right-aligning text can lead to decreased readability.

* **Font weight:** Adjust font weight to add emphasis and differentiate content hierarchy.

* **Letter spacing:** Please refrain from altering letter-spacing on our collateral. There may be rare scenarios in which this is acceptable, but generally speaking, this should be avoided altogether.
