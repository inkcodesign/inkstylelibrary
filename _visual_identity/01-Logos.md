- explanation: When the logo is being used to "watermark" a piece of content with
    a white background, it can be displayed in Neutral-300 to de-emphasize it's importance
    in the collateral.

  is-good: true
- explanation: When (and only when) the logo is effectively part of an illustration,
    it can be displayed in Green-100 or Green-800 to ensure it blends appropriately
    with the surrounding material.
