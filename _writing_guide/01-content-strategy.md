Our content strategy is rooted in providing value and relating to our target audience, not being self-promotional. With everything we create and share, we make sure we can answer the question, "How is this useful to my audience?" Writing in a consistent style helps us uphold INK's brand personality across channels and leverage our voice as a differentiator.Â

#### **Writing Mindset**

* **We have a clear understanding of our audience:** Know who they are and where they stand in their buyer's journey
* **We think about every word:** Each one should have purpose and reflect its true meaning
* **We keep things real:** No BS or over-the-top words
* **We're consistent:** Presentation and formatting is intentional and uniform
