#### **Researching**

This stage is when someone is simply searching for information or a solution to their problem. They're not seeking out an agency, but we can help them by providing smart answers to their questions.
   
**Example:** "What is analyst relations?" If INK publishes an article about analyst relations, that prospect will view INK as a knowledgeable resource for helpful content.

#### **Evaluating**

This stage is when someone is interested in hiring an outside agency or partner to help them. They're likely assessing different companies, one of which could be INK. We can appeal to these people by explaining and illustrating they way we do things at INK and why we're an awesome partner.Â 
   
**Example:** We have a unique approach to measurement. INK's Planning & Analysis philosophy might be interesting content for an evaluator to read.
