**Color Usage Guidelines**

Our primary colors consist mostly of white, green, and grey. Restricting the use of color for INK's brand applications will ensure we're communicating our professional and confident tone.

Our secondary brand colors should be used sparingly and when our company culture is the focus of the application.

Tertiary colors should be used for illustration and in data visualization when more than two shades of green are needed.
