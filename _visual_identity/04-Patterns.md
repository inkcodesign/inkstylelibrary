- explanation: Here the green pattern functions as a decorative border. A white box
    with ample padding is used to contain the text, ensuring it can be easily read.

- explanation: Here the text overlaid on the pattern is large enough to provide enough
    contrast with the pattern.

  type: good
- explanation: Here the text overlaid on the pattern is not large enough to provide
    enough contrast with the pattern. A composition with this much text would be an
    inappropriate instance to use the pattern.

- explanation: Text must be set in Starr White when overlaid on the dark pattern to
    create enough contrast.

#### **Pattern Usage**

The INK brand has three patterns that when used properly can bring additional visual interest to a composition. Any composition should feature at most one of these patterns.

Above all, when using a pattern, ensure that overlaid text is legible. See the examples below for how you can safely use these patterns in your collateral.
